## Flagstaff Mountain

Ascending Flagstaff is a rite of passage -- 1500 feet of elevation gain in less than two miles.
The best approach is to start at Chautauqua Park up Baseline Road and run the Baseline trail
(parallel to the road). Target Gregory Canyon and start the grind. The trail is steep and technical.
Winter is not the best time to pop your cherry on this as the surfaces will be slick.

Reaching the Green Mountain Lodge, make a right on one last steep section to Realization Point
and pick up the Ute Trail. Run the Ute Trail with a little bit more elevation, but eventually flattens out.
Off in the distance, views of the snow capped Rockies can be seen on a clear day.

Eventually, you'll hit the Flagstaff Trail (you'll have to cross the road to pick up the trail head).
Hold on to your shoes because the only way to descend the Flagstaff Trail is to commit. Not as technical
as Gregory Canyon, it makes for a fun, fast good ride. At one point, you'll have an option to go right (unmarked)
back towards Chautauqua Park, but I recommend to stay left on the trail and get to Panarama Point -- one
of the best overlooks on Boulder. Keep riding the trail off left to the Panarama Trail and head down to
Boulder Creek (just keep going down). Take the Creek Path to wherever you want. Congratulations, you just
did the toughest Buffs hill run.
