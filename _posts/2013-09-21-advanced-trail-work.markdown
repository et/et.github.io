Recently I wrote a piece on trail work 101. Now it's time to explore a more strenuous, labor intestive activity: rock work. Normally I wouldn't get into the logistics, but if you could humor me and allow me to tell a story.

## Background

The Truckee River is the largest tributary to Lake Tahoe, an iconic symbol to thousands of residents and millions of visitors. What happens on the Truckee River directly influences what happens downstream in Lake Tahoe and hence is seen by the masses.

Over the last 100 years, due to the insurgence of urban sprawl and flocking tourists, Tahoe is not as blue as it once was. Sure pollution is an issue, but this is not a mainstream campaign, the culprit in this situation is you...me...and all your fellow hikers.

## Meiss Meadows

Meiss Meadows is located deep off the south side of the lake roughly 8500 feet about sea level. The trailhead starts at a well traveled boulder field and then winds up a series of winding switchbacks. After a generous two miles, a restless visitor is greeted with lush rolling meadows with marshy alpine lakes inhabited by frogs and their predators.

Continuing on the trail can lead one into the primitive backcountry of the Lake Tahoe Basin/Toiyabe Wilderness. Only 3.5 miles after entering the trail, the first river crossing is hit: North Truckee River. Try this after a spring melt and you might be swimming. Try it in late summer with a poor snow year, and you'll question if there even was a river.

## The Cost of Crossing a River

A river crossing from a trail will have an obvious line of travel. Trail crews work hard to ensure that there is no discrepancy on where to go. However, sometimes people relax on the river bank or equestrians take their horse off path for a drink. This happens each year by thousands of visitors and a fragile meadow does not have the durability and ability to rehabilitate for that amount of abuse.

As the river bank erodes, the integrity of the water is affected by the soil which seeps in. Surprisingly this is not a superficial amount; it can make an undesirable affect downstream. Remember Lake Tahoe? That crystal blue lake is losing its tint and the river crossing at Meiss Meadows is one of the contributing factors.

## Broke Bank

The parks service made the task very clear: build a retaining wall on either side of the river to restore the bank.

Uhhhh...

Time to bring in some help. Heavy help.

The first step is to gather rocks -- sorry, I mean boulders. If it can be carried by yourself with the assistance of two friends, it's not big enough. Note: I will use the term 'rock' and 'boulder' synomously throughout the rest of this article.

Meadows frequently have boulders conglomerated in outcrops. For this project, we were not allowed to take boulders close the river since it's so highly frequented that the parks service rightfully declared that it would ruin the aesthetics of the trail to remove them. So off the trail and out of the line of sight, approximately thirty boulders were dug up and transported to the work site. If I said that last statement to any trail worker and didn't elaborate, I'd probably get kicked in the nuts. This is not a trivial process

## The Science of Finding and Moving a Rock

First things first, look at a boulder settled in the ground. Using a rock bar (imagine a heavy, metal pole), pry around the sides of it to unearth it and exhamine it.

* Size: is it big enough to withstand millions of gallons of rushing water? is it too big to be moved?
* Shape: does it have any flat sides that will sit well on the river floor?
* Integrity: are there any fractures (e.g. a splitting crack down the middle) that could potentially reduce the size of it?

Once a rock is selected, it's time to move it. If you're in an area that has strong trees, a rock hoist can be setup to move it. But this is a river in a meadow, trees are just not there. For this, we used a rock sling, an *extremely* strong piece of webbing (the weight limit on ours was 8,000 pounds). We positioned the rock centered on the sling and each grabbed a handle. Then we lifted and started walking until someone has to rest. Obviously the danger is high -- backs break, toes crushed. Some of the larger boulders can take up to an hour to move.

Needless to say, it takes awhile.

## World's Hardest Puzzle

After three to four days of collecting rocks, we can now start setting them. Starting a bit downstream, we selected our largest rocks as **keystones**. These rocks bear the most weight of the retaining wall so it's important they don't move otherwise everything else will shift.

Slowly and methodically, we set rocks next to each other. Again, I'll get another kick in the nuts if I don't go into the laborious details of this.

Rocks will not perfectly sit next to each other. It's nature and it's not perfect. The target with building a wall is for *high, outside contact*. What's that? High, outside contact is ensuring the rocks pin at the top on the side facing the river.

Sometimes you get lucky and they just work perfectly, other times you'll be shifting the rock for hours in various ways to achieve this. When all else fails, masonry tools are brought out and the rock is chiseled and shaped. This can be the more frustrating aspects as you could spend ten minutes on a rock or a whole day. If a rock is too stubborn to work, it may be best to just throw it away and try a different one.
