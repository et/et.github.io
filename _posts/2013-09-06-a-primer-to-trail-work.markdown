Crossing a rushing river five miles into a day hike, setting up camp next to a pristine meadow flush with blooming wildflowers deep into the Sierras -- what a great feeling. Did you ever consider how you got here? More than likely, you didn't bushwhack through shrubbery or scramble up and down a rocky pass. You probably took a well traveled trail pioneered by years of innovation and raw human power.

The beauty of all of this is the majority of the people who hike this have no clue of the difficulties and hardships it took to create it. And the intentions of a trail crew is to ensure that ignorance remains pure. We hike a trail to escape civilization and enjoy our intimacy with nature be it with close friends or entirely solo.

I would like to share with you the basics of trail work. I don't want the innocence of walking on a dirt path 18 inches wide to be more complicated than it is, but to give insight into the process so the next time you're on the trail you can admire the work as if it were a work of art.


## Step 1: New tread

The first step is simple, use a pick tool ([pulaskis][1] are great for their wide edges) and contour the land. Depending on it's use, the general rule of thumb is to go no more wide than one person/horse.

When a trail cycles around an incline, ensuring the terrain stays flat is tough but a crucial task. If the trail goes up or down, switchbacks are key to the making the hiking less strenuous and safe.

Side note: cutting a switchback causes erosion (the trail edge breaks off) and will give you bad karma. Don't be that guy.

## Step 2: Ensuring longevity

What's the point of a random line of rocks that forces people to step over? That's a [waterbar][2]. Used for draining water off the trail, waterbars can be created out of rocks (most reliable) or when none are available, a fresh fallen log. If a log is used, its bark is stripped before being used. The waterbar is set at a diagonal ditch on sloped terrain. Smaller rocks are set around it to ensure it won't move or slip when stepped on. A drainage is dug before it and diverts off the trail to guarantee no standing water.

A good waterbar will last ten years before having to be replaced. When waterbars are first set, they'll be hidden by a layer of dirt but they eventually rise above. Look at waterbars on different trails and you can usually estimate how old they are.

## Final step: Maintenance

The final piece to this primer is something that must occur annually. Relentless winters topple trees and continuously growing shrubbery need to be handled. Logs blocking the trail need to be cut and cleared. Trail workers will walk the trail with saws in hand until they find something else to cut. Sometimes this is easy, sometimes it's dangerous. Trees tend to "snap" when cut and larger ones can cause injury or death.

Beyond cutting logs, shrubs need to be trimmed back or taken out altogether. This occurs both horizontally and vertically. When possible, trail crews will try to achieve twelve feet of clearance for equestrians to pass through. Cleared shrubs are tossed off the trail preferably out of sight.

## Last thoughts

And that's it. Trail work 101 in a nutshell.
